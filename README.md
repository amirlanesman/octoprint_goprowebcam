# OctoPrint-GoProWebcam

This plugin adds a USB connected GoPro webcam option to OctoPrint.
For this plugin to work a GoPro Hero Black 9/10/11/12 has to be connected by USB to the same server OctoPrint is running on.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration

Just enter the last 3 digits of your GoPro and you're good to go.
Select the GoPro as your snapshot provider in timelapse plugin.
